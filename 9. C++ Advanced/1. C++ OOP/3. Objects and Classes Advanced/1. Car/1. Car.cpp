// 1. Car.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//You are given a program in a CarMain.cpp file that reads and creates const objects of class Car, which has the
// following attributes :
// • Brand(string)
// • Model(string)
// • Year(int)
// The program reads input and writes output to the console, using the Car class and getters for the above - mentioned attributes. Your task is to study the code in CarMain.cpp and implement the Car class in Car.h(which is #include - d by CarMain.cpp), so that CarMain.cpp compiles successfully and accomplishes the task described.Your Car.h file should resemble the following :


#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
